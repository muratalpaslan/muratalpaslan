# Murat Alpaslan

**Software Engineer** with a frontend-first background, working on real-world systems that connect web applications with industrial and embedded environments.

I focus on building interfaces and platforms that run reliably in production, often under hardware, network, or operational constraints.

---

## What I work on

- Developing **MES systems** used for robot control, monitoring, and data logging.
- Building **Linux-based kiosk and desktop interfaces** for industrial and medical devices.
- Designing **frontend architectures** that translate complex workflows into usable interfaces.
- Processing and structuring raw data coming from machines and offline networks.
- Bridging web technologies with hardware-driven systems.

## Current Responsibilities

- **Robot Control:** Panels, device monitoring, and remote management.
- **Data Engineering:** Raw data processing and logging pipelines (Node.js, MQTT, SQLite).
- **Embedded UI:** Linux-based kiosk software running on constrained systems.
- **Infrastructure:** Offline network setups and local server configurations.
- **UX/Ops:** UI decisions where usability directly affects operational efficiency.

## How I approach engineering

> "Treat interfaces as part of the system, not just the surface."

- **Data First:** Prefer clear data models over UI-driven hacks.
- **Stability:** Optimize for long-term maintainability and operational stability.
- **Pragmatism:** Avoid unnecessary abstraction unless it solves a real constraint.
- **Lifecycle:** Care about what happens after deployment, not just before release.

---

## Background

- Professional experience in **industrial and IoT-driven environments**.
- Academic background in **Management Information Systems**.
- Prior education in **English Language & Literature**, shaping strong documentation and communication skills in technical contexts.
